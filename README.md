# WhosCoding
A website that grabs and shows ratings of your friends' from different competitive coding websites (Hackerearth, Codeforces and Codechef), and the scores of the best performers from your institute in recent coding competitions (currently supports codechef long challanges only :( ).

## Rating-Wiz API
WhosCoding uses this API to fetch the ratings of the users. The API too was developed by me specifically for this project, but now is open for all and you too can use it to embed your ratings on your portfolios/personal websites.
